       <h2>Know Me Better!</h2>
   </div>

   <div class="personality-description">
       <p>My personality consists of different characteristic traits and habits which help me make a decent human being. Certain aspects of my personality are good while there are other negative sides as well. However, the following are the better aspects of my personality. I make sure I have the basic good habits which include respecting my elders, greeting people when I meet them, wishing them well when departing etc. Other than this, observing the law, serving the poor and downtrodden, helping the sick and needy, giving shelter to the homeless, assisting someone with a handicap, etc. are also other good habits of mine. To lead on a peaceful life, I develop other good habits like reading, writing, listening to music, dancing, singing etc. Going to the temple and offering prayers, giving alms to the poor, supporting the old etc. are other such habits which fulfill the needs of my soul.</p>

       <p> Promises carry with them tremendous importance. Fulfillment of a promise ensures that there is a strong bond which has been created between the two people on basis of that promise. Promises also ensure that two people come close to each other. The values of trust, faith, and honesty are tested by the strength to keep promises. Promises also signify the ability of a person. If a person is making a promise, it means that he has the ability to perform the same. Thus, I keep my promises.
        Knowledge is of utmost importance today. Knowledge gives me the ability to survive and tackle different kinds of situations. It also makes me more rational and pragmatic. Thus, I tend to understand things quicker than others and always weigh the pros and cons of a situation. Knowledge comes from learning. Learned people are known to be more efficient, more sincere and more honest than the others. The human faculties are developed by knowledge. The development of human faculties ensures fair play, equal treatment and sound judgment in various different situations.</p>

        Akin to the value of politeness, lies modesty. It is one of the finest qualities that a person can possess. A person or an individual may have a number of good qualities, but if that person is modest then he gets the respect of everyone around him. Those who are humble or modest are considered to be wise. They do not bother if anyone notices their good deeds. A modest person is one who listens to everyone with equal attention and tries to learn from others as well. Thus, I try to remain modest within my social circles.
        Honor is another aspect of my personality. Honor is a necessary prerequisite for almost everything that we do today. Honor keeps deception at bay and it helps an individual in treating others with utmost respect. Honor keeps my beliefs intact and does not allow the disposition of others in clouding my own judgment. At times, just being honourable is not good enough; one has to maintain his honor by not tarnishing it.</p>
